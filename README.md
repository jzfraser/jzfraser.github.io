# Portfoliolio

This is currently a work in progress, but is going to end up being my portfolio site once it is finished.

I plan on hosting it using GitHub pages at that point.

# Inspiration

This is heavily based off [this template](https://github.com/paytonjewell/ReactPortfolioTemplate) from Payton Pierce.
I re-wrote it myself to gain more experience/practice and use my own preferred technologies to create it.

# Made With

- Vite
- TypeScript + React
- Sass
- React-Bootstrap
- Material UI Icons
