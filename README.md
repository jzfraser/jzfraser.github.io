# Portfoliolio

This is my portfolio site, still a bit of a work in progress but very near done.

I am hosting it using GitHub pages.

# Inspiration

This is heavily based off [this template](https://github.com/paytonjewell/ReactPortfolioTemplate) from Payton Pierce.
I re-wrote it myself to gain more experience/practice and use my own preferred technologies to create it.

# Made With

- Vite
- TypeScript + React
- Sass
- React-Bootstrap
- Material UI Icons
